During the Code Crasher session on GitHub portfolios, I learned how essential it is to present your projects in a well-organized and visually appealing way. One key takeaway was the importance of detailed README files, where you can showcase project descriptions, technologies used, and provide installation steps. I also found it interesting how customizing your GitHub profile with pinned repositories, GitHub Pages, and using badges can make a significant impact in creating a professional and impressive online presence.

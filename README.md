I am a computer engineering student with a strong interest in software development and circuit design. I attended the session of Code Crasher on GitHub portfolio building to enhance my ability to showcase my projects and skills more effectively. My goal is to create a professional portfolio that highlights my technical expertise, such as my work in Android development, audio signal processing, and other engineering projects, to attract potential employers and collaborators.
